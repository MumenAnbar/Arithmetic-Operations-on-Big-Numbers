# Large Number Arithmetic Operations using Linked Lists
## overview
- This C project aims to perform arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division) on large numbers read from an input.txt file. The program represents these numbers using linked lists to overcome the limitations posed by standard data types and offers solutions to perform arithmetic operations on these large numbers. The results are then displayed in an output.txt file.
## Features
- **Large Number Representation:** Converts large numbers from input.txt into linked lists for efficient handling.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Provides functionalities for addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division of these large numbers.
- **Output to File:** Displays the computed results in an output.txt file for easy reference.
## Getting Started
### Input Format
- The input.txt file should contain two large numbers, separated  with spaces.
### Usage
1. Type numbers to be used in input.txt file.
2. Compile the code: main.c
3. Run the executable: ./main
4. Follow the prompts to perform arithmetic operations on the large numbers.
5. View the computed results in the output.txt file.
